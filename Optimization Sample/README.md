# Optimization Jupyter Notebook

The Jupyter notebook provides an easy entry point to working with our Optimization API through Python. You can clone the repository and run the notebook locally or you can use [MyBinder](https://mybinder.org).


## Running the Jupyter Notebook Locally
In order to run the notebook locally, you must have:

1. Python installed
2. Pip installed
3. pyenv / conda (or any other virtual environment) installed
4. Jupyter installed

Given the above requirements:

1. Download the notebook from the repository (or clone the repository)
2. Create a virtual environment in the "Optimization Sample" directory
3. Activate the environment
4. Run `jupyter notebook` in your terminal

## Running the Jupyter Notebook with MyBinder

1. Navigate to [MyBinder](https://mybinder.org)
2. Insert `https://github.com/analyzere/analyzere-python-examples` into the "Github Repository name or URL" field
3. Click "Launch"

This will automatically create a container with the notebook and open a tab once the container has been built.
